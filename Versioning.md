# Mile.Uefi Versioning

This document applies to all versions of Mile.Uefi.

## Version Format

- Binary Version: `<Major>.<Minor>.<Build>.<Revision>`
  - Example: `9.0.2654.0`

## The rule for build and revision number

The build number is the number of days since April 18, 2021 because that day
I start to make Mobility publicly. 

The revision number is the number of releases releases in the day corresponding
to the build number, and it counts from zero. So the first revision is 0 and 
the second revision is 1.
